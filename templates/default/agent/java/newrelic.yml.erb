  # and the agent reports data separately for each one.
  # This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for

  # For example, to report data to"My Application" and "My Application 2" use this:
  # app_name: My Application;My Application 2

  # of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page.

# Application Environments
# ------------------------------------------
# Environment specific settings are in this section.
# You can use the environment to override the default settings.
# For example, to change the app_name setting.
# Use -Dnewrelic.environment=<environment> on the Java command line
# to set the environment.
# The default environment is production.

# NOTE if your application has other named environments, you should
# provide configuration settings for these environments here.
